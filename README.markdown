## About

The ColdFusion.sugar is maintained here and is the best place to watch development and get the latest versions of the Sugar.

## Features
* Syntax Highlighting (thanks Jonathan!)
* Basic code hinting for _all_ tags (ColdFusion 8, thanks Scott!)
* Tag attribute hinting for all tags
* Code-folding (still buggy, yet improved from Scott's version)

## To Come
This Sugar is only VERY new. I'll be working on the following features in the days to come.

* Better code folding

I hope you enjoy it!
